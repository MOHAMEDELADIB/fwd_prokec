    "In the last exercise, you trained a BlazingText supervised sentiment analysis model. (Let's call this model HelloBlaze.) You've recently learned about how we can take a model we've previously trained and generate an endpoint that we can call to efficently evaluate new data. Here, we'll put what we've learned into practice. You will take HelloBlaze and use it to create an endpoint. Then, you'll evaluate some sample data on that model to see how well the model we've trained generalizes. (Sentiment analysis is a notoriously difficult problem, so we'll keep our expectations modest.)"

We won't keep track of the labels here, we're just seeing how we could potentially evaluate new data using an existing model. This code should be very familiar, and requires no modification. Something to note: it is getting tedious to have to manually process the data ourselves whenever we want to do something with our model. We are also doing this on our local machine. Can you think of potential limitations and dangers to the preprocessing setup we currently have? Keep this in mind when we move on to our lesson about batch-transform jobs.  "
